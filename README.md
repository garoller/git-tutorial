Thank you to [Daniele Procida](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html) and [Nicola Paolucci](https://www.atlassian.com/git/articles/git-forks-and-upstreams) for their amazing Git resources!

Thank you to [Ethan Graf](https://github.com/eagraf) for the [Git slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EIkRSxmPrKJvb373zW4Cls1yrxembkBJAa-_ZD3_ZNs/edit?usp=sharing)!

This tutorial is meant to take users through the basics of Git, starting from the beginning and through making changes and opening a pull request, using both branching and forking to do this.

### What you need to have installed:
1. A text editor of your choice (my favorite is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview))
2. Git on the command line
    * Windows options:
        - Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow Linux instructions below for Ubuntu
        - [Git download](https://git-scm.com/downloads). During installation select Git bash (UNIX emulator) or the Windows Command Prompt
    * [Linux and macOS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Setup Git

Tell Git who you are, so it can associate changes with your GitHub account:
```
>> git config --global user.name "your-username"
>> git config --global user.email "your-email"
```
Check that it worked:
```
>> git config --list
user.name=your-username
user.email=your-email
```

### Git conceptual
Remote repositories vs. local repositories

A **remote repository** is hosted on a website like Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.

A **local repository** is hosted on a computer, where people can set up their own environments, test the code, and make changes.

This diagrams the remote and local repositories and how they interact:

### Branching vs. forking
Creating a branch creates another list of commits with a different name.

Forking a repository creates a separate copy of the repository, including all of its branches, that is under your control.

Usually, projects will use either branching or forking to make changes, so be aware of what the project norm is an follow that method.

### With forking:

#### 1. Create your own remote repository

Go to the repository you want to fork (for this tutorial it's https://github.com/garoller/git-tutorial) and click the Fork button in the top right. This creates your own copy of the repository.
Now go to https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/git-tutorial to find your forked repository.

#### 2. Create a local repository

You'll **clone** the **remote** repository, which creates a **local** repository.

Cloning creates a new directory at the current location.

```
>> git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-tutorial.git
```

Then
```
>> cd git-tutorial
```
to change directories into the newly cloned repository.

You'll edit files, add features and documentation, etc. in your local repository.

#### 3. Make and save changes

Open the **git-tutorial** folder in the text editor of your choice.

If you're using VS Code and have it installed, type:

```
>> code .
```

to open the current folder.

If you're using a different text editor, you can look online for how to open the folder from your terminal. Or, you can open the text editor and go to **File > Open Folder**. Then select your **git-tutorial** folder. 

Then, add your name to `Contributors` list in the `README.md`.

After that you're ready to **stage** your changes.

```
>> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

`git status` gives you a breakdown of the current state of the branch you're on.

Git knows you've made changes, but you have to stage them before you can save them.

To stage your changes:

```
>> git add README.md
```

Type `git status` again to see the difference.

Now that you're changes are staged, you can save them to Git by making a **commit**.

```
>> git commit -m "Add name to contributor list"
```

The `-m` flag stands for message, which allows you to enter the commit message inline, rather than opening a text editor in the terminal, which can be confusing to navigate.

Now, type `git status` again and see the difference.

To see your commit, enter `git log`, and type `q` to exit.

#### 4. Update your remote repo

Now that you've made your first commit on the **local** repository, you want those changes to be reflected on the **remote** repository. To do that, you'll **push** your changes:
```
>> git push origin master
```

Take a look at the `README.md` on your account's git-tutorial repo to see your changes!

#### 5. Update your fork with upstream changes

At this point, after you've made changes and pushed them to the remote, the next steps are getting ready to integrate your changes into the original repository. 
The repository where you forked from is known as the **upstream** repository, and the forked repository is the **downstream**.
In this tutorial, upstream = garoller/git-tutorial and downstream = your-username/git-tutorial.

Since you cloned the repository from your account, **origin** is your-username/git-tutorial.

To verify this, check your current remotes:
```
>> git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/your-username/git-tutorial.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/your-username/git-tutorial.git (push)
```

Now, you can add the upstream repository to your remotes:
```
>> git remote add upstream https://github.com/garoller/git-tutorial.git
>> git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/your-username/git-tutorial.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/your-username/git-tutorial.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/garoller/git-tutorial.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/garoller/git-tutorial.git (push)
```

You can update from the upstream repository:
```
>> git fetch upstream
>> git merge upstream/master
```

#### 6. Resolving conflicts

At this step, you might have encountered a merge conflict. If not though, that's great, and you're ready for the next step.

If you do have a merge conflict, don't worry!
You might be seeing output similar to this:
```
>> git merge upstream/master
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
Basically, merge conflicts happen when the same line has been modified, and Git doesn't know which change(s) to keep. This requires a human to manually decide.
Open the file where the conflict is. In this tutorial, open `README.md`. If you're using VS Code, you should see `HEAD` (current change) and `upstream/master` (incoming change). Pick whether you want to keep only one of the changes or both. Also, make sure you remove the labels and the arrows from the file.

Save your file, and head back to the terminal. Type 
```
>> git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
and then enter:
```
>> git add README.md
>> git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

resolve the merge conflict.
Now, you can update the remote repository with these new changes:
```
>> git push origin master
```

#### 7. Making a pull request

Up to this point, you've made changes to the original code base and updated your remote repositiory with those changes. Now you want to contribute back to the original repo.

To do this you'll open a **pull request**. Pull requests basically just merge one branch into another. But, pull requests are often used so maintainers can make sure the code getting merged in works and is up to project standards. They're also a great way to get feedback on your code. 

Go to your reposititory on GitHub. Click the **New pull request** button. Under the title **Open a pull request**, click the **compare across forks** option.

Set the following repositories and branches:
Base repository: **garoller/git-tutorial**, and base: **master**.
Head repository: **your-username/git-tutorial**, and base: **master**.

After this you should see a message: **Able to merge**.

Now enter a descriptive title and description for your PR. Click **Create pull request**.


### Branching:

#### 1. Create a local branch

Create a new branch, 
```
>> git checkout -b new-branch-name
```
`-b` creates a new branch, and `checkout` immediately switches to that branch.

To get to switch to an existing branch, just use:
```
>> git checkout branch-name
```

#### 2. See make and save changes above

Make any change(s) you wish to the file on your `new-branch-name`, and add and commmit those changes like you did above.

#### 3. Update your remote repo

The steps are almost the same as above, except instead of pushing to remote `master`, you'll want to create a remote branch `new-branch-name`. 

By entering:
```
>> git push origin new-branch name
```

the remote `new-branch-name` is created if it doesn't exist already.

#### 5. Update your branch with changes on remote master branch

If the project you're working on uses branching, you don't have to worry about an upstream repository. Instead, other contributors working on the same project will update the remote master. To make sure you're working with the current code base and to resolve any conflicts locally it is good to:
```
>> git fetch
>> git merge origin/master
```

regularly.


#### 6. See resolving conflicts above

#### 7. Making a pull request

The process for opening a PR from a branch is very similar to the process described for forking, with a few changes.

Go to your reposititory on GitHub. Click the **New pull request** button.

Set the following branches:
base: **master**, compare: **your-branch**.

After this you should see a message: **Able to merge**.

Now enter a descriptive title and description for your PR. Click **Create pull request**.

### Miscellaneous

#### Git ignore
A `.gitignore` is used so that Git will ignore certain files. If a file is the your `.gitignore`, it will not appear when you type `git status`.
Git ignore files are useful for things that you need to run your project locally, but don't want on your public, remote repository, like config files, anything files with secret keys, log files, database files, etc.

#### Helpful commands

`git log` - shows the local commit history

`git status` - shows what branch you're currently on, and staged, unstaged, and untracked files

`git branch` - shows all local branches

`git stash` - removes all uncommitted changes from the working directory, but stores them to use for later

`git stash pop` - applies the latest stashed changes back onto the working directory

`git reset --hard` - deletes all uncommitted changes

`git reset .` - unstages all staged files

`git reset HEAD~1` - removes the most recent commit 

`git checkout <filename>` - remove all uncommitted changes from `filename`


#### Setting up an SSH key

Clone the repository using SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/git-tutorial.git
```
